# Yantra A.I.
This Project aims at developing an AI assistant for desktop having speech based operations in addition to text.

The source code is contained in $\textit{main.py}$ and $\textit{Yantra.ipynb}$ in different formats.

Yantra can help you open a website by simply speaking - "$\textbf{Open <name of website>}$". In case the website is not present in its database, it'll prompt you to enter its url and name to be referred as text. The site info would then be stored in the $\textit{sites.csv}$ file. Yantra now knows which site to access in case the name is called again.

It can also help you to play songs stored in the local memory by the voice command: "$\textbf{Play <name of song>}$". 

This tool keeps on running and accepting voice inputs until "$\textbf{Shut down}$" command is recieved as voice input.
