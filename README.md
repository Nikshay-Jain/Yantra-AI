# Yantra
This Project aims at developing an assistant for desktop having speech based operations in addition to text for your assistance.

The source code is contained in $\textit{main.py}$ and $\textit{Yantra.ipynb}$ in different formats.

This tool helps you simplify your daily operations on your computer greatly by inducing speech sensitive response mechanism.

Yantra performs the following operations with ease:
1. Yantra can help you open a website on the internet or an app on your local drive by simply speaking - $\textbf{``Open (name of website/app)''}$.

2. Getting bored and want to listen to a pleasing song from your local computer?
Just say: $\textbf{``Play (name of song)''}$

--> In case the website or app or the song you asked for is not present in its database, it'll prompt you to enter its name and url as text.

--> The label and location info would then be stored in the $\textit{sites.csv}$ file which acts as its database. Yantra now knows which site to access in case the name is called again.

--> If you choose not to enter anything about the site currently, worry not, just enter $\textbf{``q''}$ in name section and find the prompt disabled.

3. Like to be on time everywhere? Just ask $\textbf{``What's the time currently?''}$

4. Forgot today's date? Just ask $\textbf{``What's today's date?''}$.

5. Want to know the current weather details of any city worldwide? Just ask $\textbf{``What's the weather like?''}$. Yantra then asks you the name of the city and the deatils are with you in seconds!

6. Like to stay updated about the current affairs? Just say $\textbf{``Tell me some news Yantra!''}$. Yantra asks your domain of interests and reads out top 3 headlines containing the keywords.

7. Once activated, Yantra is always at your command, accepting your voice inputs until $\textbf{``Shut down''}$ command is recieved as a voice input.

We wish to add new features as per your requirements and are always open for improvements, so feel free to point out any bug or an improvement necessary to make Yantra better.

Hope Yantra helps simplify your experience of using this machine.

Yantra! Just say!
